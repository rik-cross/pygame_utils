PygamePal documentation!
========================

PygamePal is a library of classes and functions to support game development in Pygame.

PygamePal provides commonly-used features such as sprite animation, cameras, scenes, etc. which can be used together or independently. PygamePal integrates well with Pygame -- use PygamePal for the things you want, and continue to use Pygame for everything else!
